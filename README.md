Be sure to read **all** of this document carefully, and follow the guidelines within.

## Flutter Version

We use differente projects versions depending on what we want to achieve. We stay between stable and beta. Please user a flutter version greater than or equal to `2.5.0` for the challenge. User dart `2.13.0` or greater.

## Requirements

### App Structure


## Test Coverage

To demonstrate your experience writing different types of tests in Flutter please do the following:

- Choose ONE class and achieve 100% test coverage.
- Choose ONE page and achieve 100% test coverage.

Feel free to add more tests as you see fit but the above is the minimum requirement.

## Design



## Technical Requirements

### State Management

Please restrict your usage of state or dependency injection to the following options:

1. [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc/versions/7.2.0-dev.3)
2. [riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod/versions/1.0.0-dev.7)
3. [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
4. [riverbloc](https://pub.dev/packages/riverbloc/versions/1.0.0-dev.1)

We ask this because this challenge values consistency and efficiency over ingenuity. Using commonly used libraries ensures that we can review your code in a timely manner and allows us to provide better feedback.

## Coding Values

At **Hypervolt** we strive to build applications that have

- Consistent architecture
- Extensible, clean code
- Solid testing
- Good security & performance best practices

We value great development practices in general, like clear and cosistent commits.

### Clear, consistent architecture

Approach your submission as if it were a real world app. This includes Use any libraries that you would normally choose.

_Please note: we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library or feature._

### Easy to understand

Writing boring code that is easy to follow is essential at **Hypercolt**.

More on [boaring code](https://verygood.ventures/blog/boring-code-part-1).

We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result.

### Solid testing approach

While the purpose of this challenge is not to guage whether you can achieve 100% test coverage, we do seek to evaluate whether you know how & what to test.

## Bonus Requirements

If you are feeling up to it and want to add some more functionality to the application try some of these bonus items:
